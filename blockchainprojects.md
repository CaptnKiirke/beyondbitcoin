### Description

An interesting project in creating a social network that rewards is decentralised and rewards its contributors. It uses its own blockchain and a 'Delegated Proof of Stake' block generation mode to store all the posts and data that operate the platform. This is the first real operating example we have found of a platform for end-users that doesn't just use the blockchain as a means of issuing currency but uses the blockchain to distribute decentralised data stores. 

All the text and post architecture as well as the STEEM currency(ies) are decentralised.

If you like a post you can simply reward the author with a micropayment that is exchangeable for real currency. 

### Comment/Analysis

As this is a relatively succesful experiment its worth asking how and in what ways this alters the nature of social media. It does seem to encourage longer form posts than something like facebook but these tend to be somewhat 'click baitey' as people look for post that pay. I wonder if there are other ways of rewarding authors - like your reward is based on the how long people read your posts, or the length of comments contributing to the thread.

I'm really interesetd in these collaborative economies... and the question as to weather the abstraction of value effect the mode of agagement and production.
