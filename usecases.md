# Use Cases

Please contribute possible, tested or pontificated projects and uses cases.
How might we use the blocakchain to build new things?

## A Distributed Runner Ranking System.

At the moment there is a war in the Ultra-Running community as two power brokers fight for control of the sport. Part of this fight is over the ITRA ranking system which ranks runners based on performance and charges race directors for inclusion. This is a proprietary centralised for profit system (even if that profit is subsidiary). Could this system be decentralised?

## Local Cash. 

Could contribution to local communities in terms of volunteering and common-good contribution be paid in 'Local Coin' that is fungible between organisations. Perhaps my contribution to the Coop is exchgaeable for a reduction in membership at the surf club? Perhaps contribution to surf patrols is exchangeable for rice at the Coop? Does this undermine the contribution?
