# Beyond Bitcoin

This repository will be used as a means of documenting, sharing and collaborating as we explore the technologies and ideas that that are fueling the current excitement (hype?) and interest in cryptocurrencies. 

The direction of workshop will be shaped by the interests of those that take part - and perhaps feel free to add something to this introduction in order to help frame that interest. 

Part of what motivates Polygon Door's interest in the technology is the potential (or otherwise) for the Blockchain to make new forms of (political, social, and economic) organisation possible and to work out what the shape and dynamic of those organisations might 'look' and 'feel' like. 

We are less/not interested in cryptocurrency as a form of investment opportunity - alhtough our lack interest shouldn't preclude yours - and are not so interested in the economic value of a particular coin and much more interested in exploring how the technology might be 'hacked' to creative or organisational ends. I suppose you could say we are more interested in the 'cryto-anarchist' roots and vector of the technology - although that too is inseperable from the use of the blockchain in the realisation of 'fungible' currency.

Our method will be exploratory - making sense of the technology - getting in and playing with Ethereum and Solidity as a means of immersing oursleves in the possibilities and dynamics of the Blockchain technology.
